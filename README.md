## User Roles and Permissions

The API implements three distinct user roles:

- **Admin**: Full access to all resources and operations.
- **Seller**: Can manage their own products and variants, view categories.
- **Buyer**: Read-only access to catalog data.

See [ROLE_PERMISSIONS.md](./ROLE_PERMISSIONS.md) for detailed information about role permissions.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MySQL (v8 or higher)
- Redis (optional, for enhanced caching)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gihozoinnocente/product-catalog-api.git
   cd product-catalog-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables by creating a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and other settings.

5. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   # Create a database in MySQL
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE product_catalog;"
   
   # The application will automatically create the tables when started in development mode
   ```

6. Start the server:
   ```bash
   # Development mode
   npm run dev
   
   # Production mode
   npm start
   ```

7. Access the Swagger API documentation:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api-docs
   ```

## API Authentication

To access protected endpoints, you must include a valid JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token>
```

To obtain a token:

1. Register a new user: `POST /api/auth/register`
2. Login to get a token: `POST /api/auth/login`


## Database Schema

The application uses the following main data models:

- **Users**: Authentication and role-based access control
- **Categories**: Hierarchical organization of products
- **Products**: Core product information with seller association
- **Variants**: Variations of products (sizes, colors, etc.)
- **Inventory**: Stock management for products and variants
