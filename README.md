- **MySQL** - Relational database
- **Sequelize** - ORM for MySQL
- **Swagger** - API documentation
- **JWT** - Authentication mechanism

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MySQL (v8 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gihozoinnocente/product-catalog-api.git
   cd product-catalog-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables by creating a `.env` file based on the provided `.env.example`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and other settings.

5. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   # Create a database in MySQL
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE product_catalog;"
   
   # The application will automatically create the tables when started in development mode
   ```

6. Start the server:
   ```bash
   # Development mode
   npm run dev
   
   # Production mode
   npm start
   ```

7. Access the Swagger API documentation:
   ```

   ```

## Database Schema

The application uses the following main data models:

- **Categories**: Hierarchical organization of products
- **Products**: Core product information
- **Variants**: Variations of products (sizes, colors, etc.)
- **Inventory**: Stock management for products and variants

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Server Error

Error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "message": "Error message",
    "details": [
      {
        "field": "fieldName",
        "message": "Specific error for this field"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Data Validation

Input validation is performed using express-validator. All endpoints that accept request bodies validate the input data and return appropriate error messages if validation fails.

## Testing

Run the automated tests:

```bash
npm test
```

You can also test the API manually using tools like:
- Postman
- cURL
- VS Code's REST Client extension

## Development

For development purposes, the server can be run in development mode, which enables:
- Automatic server restart on file changes (nodemon)
- Detailed logging
- Database schema synchronization

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Assumptions and Limitations

- The API assumes that product variants have their own inventory records.
- Categories can have a hierarchical structure, but deleting a category with subcategories is not allowed.
- The API doesn't include user authentication and authorization, which would be necessary in a production environment.
- The current implementation doesn't include webhooks or events for inventory changes.

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication and authorization
- Order management integration
- Webhook support for inventory changes
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Media management for product images
- Cache implementation for improved performance
